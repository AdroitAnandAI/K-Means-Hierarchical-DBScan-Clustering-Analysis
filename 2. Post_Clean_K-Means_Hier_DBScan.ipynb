    "**The preprocessing step has produced final.sqlite file after doing the data preparation & cleaning.** The review text is now devoid of punctuations, HTML markups and stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "To find meaningful clusters using **unsupervised clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical & DBScan** on the review dataset. The **polarity of the review is removed from the input dataset,** so that the clustering would happen just on the review text given. \n",
    "\n",
    "4 standard featurizations are used, namely **BoW, tf-idf, W2V and tf-idf weighted W2V featurizations**. Cross validaton or test metrics in supervised algorithm cannot be used as there is no test data. Instead, **random samples from clusters formed are analyzed manually and a conclusion should be arrived at.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## At a glance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **elbow method is used to find the right # of clusters of K-Means. The minPoints for DBScan is set as double the number of dimension of W2V vectors**, as a rule of thumb. The **Eps value is calculated using KNN distance plots.** The point at which the slope of the plot is higher than a set threshold is taken as Eps value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical clustering algorithm is run with different 'k' values & DBScan also is executed with different Eps values. so that the impact of change in hyperparameters can be well understood."
