# K-Means-Hierarchical-DBScan-Clustering-Analysis #
Hyperparameter Tuning of K-Means using Elbow Method, Eps values based on MinPoints for DBScan and Hierarchical Clustering based on various values of 'k' is done to form different clusters, on which an analysis is done for semantic coherence. 

## Amazon Fine Food Review Dataset ##

**Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of **reviews of fine foods from Amazon**. <br/>
Number of reviews                   : **568,454**  <br/>
Number of users                     : 256,059  <br/>
Number of products                  : 74,258  <br/>
Timespan: Oct 1999                  : Oct 2012  <br/>
Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10 <br/>

### Attribute Information ###
1. Id <br/>
2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product <br/>
3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user <br/>
4. ProfileName <br/>
5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful <br/>
6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not <br/>
7. Score - rating between 1 and 5 <br/>
8. Time - timestamp for the review <br/>
9. Summary - brief summary of the review <br/>
10. Text - text of the review <br/>

## Objective ##

The code below would **clean the review text from html tags and punctuations and write it as a new column in the database and write it to disk**. This is further taken up in Part 2 to find accuracy of 10-fold cross validation KNN on vectorized input data, for each of the 4 featurizations, namely BoW, tf-IDF, W2V, tf-IDF weighted W2V.

## Significant Points ##

1. **Duplication of reviews** are found with same userid and timestamp (Cleaned).
2. Found discrepancy issues with HelpfulnessDenominator (Cleaned).
3. final.sqlite db is **to be used for further processing** such as Text to Vector operations.
4. The preprocessing step is one time effort but the training & visualization steps require multiple runs. Hence, it is prudent to make reprocessing step independant, to avoid multiple runs.
